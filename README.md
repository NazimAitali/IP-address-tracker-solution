### Useful resources

- [Ipify](https://www.ipify.org/) - is a simple public IP address API, easy enough to integrate into any application in seconds.
- [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/). It's free to use and doesn't require an API Key. If you decide to use another API, like Google Maps or Mapbox, be sure to secure your API Key. Here are guides for both Google Maps and Mapbox, be sure to read through them thoroughly:
